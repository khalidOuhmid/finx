# Stock Prediction API Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
Develop a Spring Boot API for stock price prediction using Apache Spark, MongoDB/Cassandra, and Deeplearning4j.

## User Stories / Tasks

### 1. Data Ingestion and Storage
- [ ] US1: As a developer, I want to set up a Cassandra database to store time-series stock data.
- [ ] US2: Implement a data ingestion pipeline using Apache Spark to fetch and store stock data.
- [ ] US3: Create a scheduled job to update stock data periodically.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- [ ] US4: Implement feature engineering for stock data (e.g., technical indicators, moving averages).
- [ ] US5: Develop a data normalization pipeline for machine learning input.
- [ ] US6: Create a mechanism to generate LSTM-compatible sequences from time-series data.

### 3. Machine Learning Model
- [ ] US7: Design and implement a basic LSTM model using Deeplearning4j.
- [ ] US8: Develop a training pipeline for the LSTM model.
- [ ] US9: Implement model evaluation and validation mechanisms.

### 4. API Development
- [ ] US10: Create a RESTful endpoint for stock price prediction.
- [ ] US11: Implement error handling and input validation for the API.
- [ ] US12: Develop an endpoint to retrain the model on demand.

### 5. Integration and Testing
- [ ] US13: Integrate Spark data processing with the Spring Boot application.
- [ ] US14: Set up integration tests for the entire prediction pipeline.
- [ ] US15: Implement unit tests for critical components.

### 6. Performance and Scalability
- [ ] US16: Optimize Spark jobs for better performance.
- [ ] US17: Implement caching mechanisms for frequent predictions.
- [ ] US18: Set up monitoring and logging for the application.

### 7. Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] US19: Create API documentation using Swagger.
- [ ] US20: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] US21: Write a comprehensive README and developer guide.

## Priority Order
1. Data Ingestion and Storage (US1, US2)
2. Basic API Setup (US10)
3. Data Preprocessing (US4, US5)
4. Initial ML Model (US7, US8)
5. Integration (US13)
6. Testing and Validation (US14, US15)
7. Performance Optimization (US16)
8. Documentation (US19, US21)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the development environment (Java, Maven, IDE)
3. Install and configure Cassandra
4. Run the Spring Boot application

## Next Steps
- Begin with US1 and US2 to set up the data infrastructure
- Move on to US10 to have a basic API structure in place
- Proceed with data preprocessing (US4, US5) to prepare for ML model development
